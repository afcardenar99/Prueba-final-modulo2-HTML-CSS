### 🚀 Key Features

This project was built to excel in the evaluation criteria:

* **Semantic HTML Structure:** The HTML is organized using semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to ensure the code is readable, accessible, and maintainable.  This directly addresses the "Estructura semántica" rubric.
* **Modern & Cohesive Design:** It features a clean, professional design with a consistent color scheme (managed by CSS variables), custom web fonts (Google Fonts), and thoughtful spacing. This targets the "Diseño" category. 
* **Fully Responsive Layout:** Built with a **mobile-first** approach, the site adapts fluidly to all screen sizes. It uses both **Flexbox** for flexible component alignment and **CSS Grid** for complex layouts, as required by the test topics.  This is for the "Responsividad" rubric.
* **CSS Best Practices:**
* **CSS Variables:** For easy theme management (colors, fonts).
* **Transitions & Animations:** Subtle animations on interactive elements (`:hover`) to improve user experience, fulfilling a key topic requirement.
